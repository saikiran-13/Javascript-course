Javascript can be written in 3 ways inside head or body or external file.js and link it using src inside script file
Javascript is written into HTML web page to make it interactive and uses embedded engine in browser called javascript engine or runtime
it has so limited properties i.e.,privacy concern
Everything in javascript happens inside execution context
Developers tools:
when you click on inspect on the browser, u will find some tools like elements,console,sources,network etc..
element:contains all the HTML Elements,what are the tags you have used basically html,css,script code and able to find the element tags by clicking the arrow
console:contains the errors and exceptions,also all our messages are logged.
network:This tab contains all the network requests
lighthouse:generates the report about how fast your website is loading and what improvements can be done in your website
If we use external script ,we have 2 benefits:
1)Browser caching:Browser caching is a process that involves the temporary storage of resources in web browsers.
 A visitorâ€™s web browser downloads various website resources and stores them in the local drive.
 The web browser will store the static web resources in a cache to improve your experience 
 These include images, HTML files, and JavaScript files. When the user visits the website subsequently,
the web page will load faster and the bandwidth usage will be reduced.
2)seperation of concerns:say 5 scripts.js files one u can add highlighting code,2nd u can add playing music on website,3rd adding timer
   next one taking care of what buttons have been cliked by user and their respective actions etc...
